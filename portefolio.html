        <h2>Samsun Nahar Lima</h2>
        <p>
            I am a freelance graphic designer and photographer based in Los Angeles, CA. I have a BFA in Graphic Design 
            from the Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA in Graphic Design from the California Institute of the Arts. 
            I have worked as a graphic designer and photographer for over 10 years and have been teaching design and photography 
            classes at the collegiate level for the past 5 years. I aim to combine both design and photography to ensure the two 
            disciplines in my work are both beautiful and functional. Good photography should tell a story and capture a moment in time.
